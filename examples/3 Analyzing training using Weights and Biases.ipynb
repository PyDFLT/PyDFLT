    "# 3 Analyzing training using Weights and Biases\n",
    "Weights and biases (wandb) is an effective tool for training machine learning models (free for academic use). The `Runner` has an argument called `use_wandb`, which when set to `True` will use weights and biases. In this notebook we show how wandb can be used effectively. First we show how it can help, after we show how to set it up for yourself.\n"

Outside of regular quality metrics, some direct prediction and decision metrics are also recorded. In the above panels for example one can see validation/arc_costs_mean and validation/select_arc_mean, which show the average predicted costs and the average number of selected arcs at each epoch.\n",
