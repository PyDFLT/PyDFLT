    "## 2.1 Registries\n",
    "To make it easy to use different models, data and DFL methods from literature, we created different registries in `pydflt.registries`. These 3 categories are stored here with the settings as they are relevant and appear in literature. It also makes it easy to specify a base version of a model, data or decision maker. Below are the currently stored registries. In the files themselves there are some comments regarding works that use about the same configuration, with slightly different parameters\n"
